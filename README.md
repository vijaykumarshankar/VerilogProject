# VerilogProject
FPGA based Advanced Traffic Light controller
Designed a traffic controller for a sequence of 4-way intersection using Verilog HDL.Implemented it on a Xilinx FPGA using Finite State Machine (FSM) model.Verified the synchronized operation using Vivado HLS.

FPGA based Vending Machine
Designed a vending machine by an event-driven model to detect and return the balance amount for the product. Implemented it using Verilog HDL on Intel Altera FPGA with the generation of control signals. Verified the functionality of the Vending Machine using a test bench. 

Technical Skills: Verilog, Synopsys VCS, Vivado HLS, Altera.
